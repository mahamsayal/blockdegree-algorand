# BlockDegree (Algorand + DID)

BlockDegree is a decentralized application (dApp) that leverages **Algorand blockchain** and **Decentralized Identity (DID/SSI)** to solve the problem of **fake academic degree certificates**. 

---

## 🚀 Problem
Fake degree certificates are a major issue for universities, students, and employers:
- Employers struggle to verify authenticity.
- Students with genuine degrees face competition from fraudulent applicants.
- Universities have no simple, global way to prove issued certificates.

---

## 💡 Solution
BlockDegree provides a **tamper-proof, verifiable degree system**:
- Universities issue degree credentials on Algorand blockchain.
- Students hold their verified degrees in a DID-based digital wallet.
- Employers can instantly verify authenticity via blockchain records.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Algorand Blockchain** for issuing and verifying credentials.  
- **DID (Decentralized Identity) & SSI** standards for identity-linked certificates.  
- **Frontend Demo** (Visme Presentation link here).  
- **Backend/Smart Contract** (future development).  

---

## 🎯 Target Users
- Universities / Educational Institutes  
- Students / Job Seekers  
- Employers / Recruiters  

---

## 📌 Current Status
- Idea stage with prototype design (Visme POC).  
- Exploring Algorand smart contract integration for issuing credentials.  

---

## 🔮 Roadmap (Next 6–12 Months)
- Build MVP for university-issued degrees.  
- Partner with at least one educational institution for pilot testing.  
- Develop employer verification dashboard.  
- Seek funding and early adopters.
